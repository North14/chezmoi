I never hit the point of needing mods, but when I was streaming one viewer did ask to be modded. I said no and only had a couple more streams before stopping anyway. At that point I had a max of 9 viewers I think, and maybe 7 active in chat at once, easy enough to do myself. But my question is when do you decide whether you need mods"
